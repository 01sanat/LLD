1. Creational Patterns deal with object creation mechanism 
   
  -> Singleton : Ensures that class has only one instance and provides global point of access to that instance.

  -> Factory Method : Creates Object Without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. 
  This is especially useful when the exact class of the object is determined at runtime.
  For example we do in backend by dynamically decides which database client to use (e.g., PostgreSQL or mysql or mongodb).

  -> Builder :Unlike the Factory Method, which focuses on selecting and creating objects,
   the Builder Pattern is about creating an object piece by piece, often providing flexibility 
   in the construction process. It's especially useful when an object has multiple optional parameters 
   or requires a series of steps to initialize.

   How the Builder Pattern Works Here
   1. Flexibility: allows you to set only the parameters you need
   2. Separation of Concerns 
   3. The chaining method (setFilters, setSorting, etc.) makes the query-building process intuitive and readable.
